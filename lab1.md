# This is lab report 1 for CSE 15L

## 1.1) - Using `cd` with no arguments

Using `cd` with no argument will return the user to the home directory.

The absolute path to the working directory before running the command was:
`/c/Users/noahs/lecture1`

This is the expected output because using `cd` with no arguments is meant to return the user to the root directory
This output is not an error.

## 1.2) - Using `ls` with no arguments

Using `ls` with no arguments will list the files / folders in the given path.

The absolute path to the working directory before running the command was:
`/c/Users/noahs/lecture1`

I got this output because `ls` is meant to list the files / folders in a given path. Since my working directory was in `lecture1`, using `ls` listed all of the files and folders within `lecture1` which were `Hello.class`,  `Hello.java`,  `messages/`, and  `README`.

This output is not an error
